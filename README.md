A full-featured Home Assistant integration for [Norish](https://github.com/norish-recipes/norish) — the open-source recipe and meal planning app.

> **This is a fork** of [Caps3n/hass-norish](https://github.com/Caps3n/hass-norish), tracking
> upstream and adding a few fixes of its own. Report issues with *this* fork here; for the
> original integration, please use the upstream repository.

> Connects your Norish instance to Home Assistant, giving you meal sensors, a shopping list, a calendar, recipe images, and video support — all in one integration.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Integration shows "Setup error" / stops working after a few hours**
- Your API key has expired. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Norish → ⋮ → Reconfigure** and enter a new key from your Norish settings under **API Keys**.
- The integration tolerates up to 2 transient auth errors before disabling itself, so brief server hiccups are handled automatically.

**No meals shown / "No meals planned"**
- Check the integration is active (not showing a setup error)
- Past meals are automatically hidden: Breakfast after 08:30, Lunch after 12:30, Snack after 15:30, Dinner after 18:30
- Future days always show all meals regardless of time

**No images displayed**
- Check if your Norish instance returns image URLs
- Verify the images are accessible from your Home Assistant host

**Connection error on setup**
- Confirm the Server URL is reachable from Home Assistant
- Verify your API key is correct (Settings → Norish → API Keys)
- Check firewall / reverse proxy settings

**Enable debug logging**

Add to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.norish: debug
```

## 🆕 What's New in v1.7.0

- **Calendar notes** — Norish now supports free-text notes on any time slot (e.g. "Going out for dinner"). Notes are now displayed in the Home Assistant calendar:
  - If a recipe is planned, the note appears in the **event description** (visible when you tap the event).
  - If no recipe is planned, the note becomes the **event title** — so a slot with "Going out to eat" shows up with that text instead of the generic "Meal" label.
- Fully backwards-compatible: existing setups without notes are unaffected.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full version history.

---

## 🆕 What's New in v1.6.10

- **Startup timeout fix** — if the Norish server isn't reachable when Home Assistant boots (e.g. HA starts before Norish is ready), the integration now triggers a graceful retry via `ConfigEntryNotReady` instead of crashing permanently with a `TimeoutError`.
- **Longer validation timeout** — increased from 10 s to 30 s to handle slow server starts and high-latency networks.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full version history.

---

## 🆕 What's New in v1.6.9

- **Automatic API key renewal** — when the key is exhausted the integration silently creates a new one using your stored Norish credentials. No manual "Reconfigure" needed.
- **Optional credentials** — enter your Norish email + password in the setup or reconfigure form to enable auto-renewal. The password is stored as a masked field and never shown in plaintext.
- **Fallback** — if no credentials are stored, the existing behaviour is kept: after 3 consecutive 401 errors Home Assistant shows the "Reconfigure" notification.
- **Exponential reconnect backoff** (v1.6.8) — 1st failure → 60 s, 2nd → 5 min, 3rd+ → 10 min before next retry; auto-restores to normal interval on success.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full version history.
